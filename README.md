# Andrew Mendoza

## Introduction

	I am currently on a path to start a new career and highly motivated to succeed in this field. I have spent years in the trucking industry and 
currently am giving my entire time an energy to this new career that I hope will eventually lead me into cyber security and other things that I can learn
to help my family and myself not get left behind in technological advances that I feel I can contribute to and be a part of for a better future for us all. 
Im the kind of person that likes to think outside the box and likes to solve problems. Im also creative and artistic.
